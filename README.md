# flight-delay-prediction
This project aims to create a flight delay warning system for the Pittsburgh International Airport. It uses the historical data to build several classfier models that predicts whether the flight will be delayed or on-time in 2017. This project was created to explore my academic interest in the field of Machine Learning.

Significant features:
 
  1. Built specifically for the Pittsburgh International Airport
  2. Looks at flights that are inbound or outbound to Pittsburgh
  3. Provides a detailed assessment of the various classification models
 
Note: The data for this project is sourced from the U.S Department of Transportation - Bureau of Transportation and Statistics
